# Extenject 

This repository hosts a customized version of the **Extenject** dependency injection framework for Unity, with the **'OptionalExtras'** directory removed to streamline the package. It's tailored for developers who require the core functionality of Extenject without the additional utilities and extensions found in **''OptionalExtras'**'.
